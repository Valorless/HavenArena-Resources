# Here we'll define specific waves for specific arenas, 
# where the players will be teleported to another section of the arena.

# Careful not to have MobArena's config setting "spawnpoint-max-distance" set too high,
# Otherwise mob can spawn away from the advancing point, possibly soft-locking the arena.
